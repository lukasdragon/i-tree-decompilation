    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

\b0\par
\pard\brdrt\brdrs\brdrw10\brsp20 The table seen in the action panel to the right provides estimates of the effects that trees have on the ultraviolet (UV) radiation received in your study area. UV radiation is emitted by the sun and while beneficial to humans in small doses, can have negative health effects when people are overexposed. The UV index scale was developed by the World Health Organization to more easily communicate daily levels of UV radiation and alert people to when protection from overexposure is needed most. UV index values are estimated from UV radiation and adjusted based on local elevation and cloud cover.\par
\par
Tree canopies help to reduce the amount of UV radiation that reaches the ground thus providing people with additional protection from the sun\rquote s harmful rays. UV effects are reported in this table for each stratum and the study area as a whole and broken into the following results:\par
\par
\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720 UV Effects in Tree Shade \endash  changes in UV for a person who is always shaded by tree canopy. For example, someone who is sitting under a tree.\par
{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}UV Effects Overall \endash  changes in UV for a person who is in both areas that are shaded by tree canopy and areas that are not. For example, someone who is walking down a street may find themselves under tree canopy at some times and exposed to full UV radiation at others.\par
\pard\fi-360\li720\b\par
\pard\b0 Results are additionally reported for the following:\par
\par
\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720 Protection factor \endash  a unitless value meant to capture the UV radiation-blocking capacity of trees. It is comparable to the SPF rating in sunscreen and calculated as unshaded UV index divided by shaded or overall UV index.\par

\pard\b0\par
The \b Configurations\b0  group in the ribbon above is important for managing your Forecast parameters. One of the useful features of Forecast is that you can make use of the component many different ways by projecting future estimates with any number of combinations of settings, tree planting scenarios, and extreme events. Each one of these combinations is a different configuration and can be defined by going through the Basic or Custom Options of the ribbon. You can also choose to run Forecast without providing any special information and simply using the defaults provided.\par
\par
The \b Active Configuration\b0  drop-down list is where you select which configuration you would like to work with. You will see all of the parameters (i.e., mortality options, tree planting scenarios, and extreme events) that you defined in the functions of the action panel. Please note that the configuration that is selected here will define the settings for your results when you run Forecast. Always check which configuration is selected before running Forecast.\par
\par
The \b Rename\b0 , \b New\b0 , \b Duplicate\b0 , and \b Delete\b0  tools allow you to rename the active configuration, create a new configuration, duplicate the active configuration, or delete the active configuration.\par
\par
The \b Restore Defaults\b0  function will reset all parameters (i.e., mortality options, tree planting scenarios, and extreme events) that you have set for the active configuration back to the default values.\par

\b0 The \b Dieback \b0 field seen in the action panel to the right describes tree crown health as estimated during data collection. Crown health is based on a visual assessment of the amount of dead branches (i.e., dieback) in the crown. To record dieback, users will collect the percent of the crown that is composed of dead branches. i-Tree Eco includes 22 default dieback classes. \par
\par
Users may choose to record crown health as condition instead of dieback. To change how you would like to record crown health, go to \b Project Definition\b0  &gt; \b Data Collection Options\b0 .\par

This variable is used to determine how many years into the future your results will be forecasted. For example, if you choose to use the default, the Forecast component will estimate the structure and function of the urban forest in your study area every year for the next 30 years (see Notes below).\par
\b{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}Days of the year without frost (days) \b0\endash  i-Tree Eco default is 150 days. This variable is used to determine the growing season of your study area, which adjusts growth in tree DBH (diameter at breast height) over time.\par
\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\b Base annual mortality rates (%) \b0\endash  The values presented here show the default annual mortality rates for healthy trees with 0-49% dieback (3.0% annual mortality), sick trees with 50-74% dieback (13.1% annual mortality), and dying trees with 75-99% dieback (50.0% annual mortality). You may change the base mortality rates for each of these condition classes. The rate that you provide indicates the percent of trees in that condition class that will die each year. For healthy trees, this mortality rate is an average starting rate that is adjusted up or down depending on the tree DBH class.\par

\pard\fs20 The \b Trees\b0  table seen in the action panel to the right displays the tree data that you collected in the field (see Notes below). This is where you will enter your tree data manually or edit your previously added or imported data. While working in this table, you may use the tools in the \b Actions\b0  group to help manually enter new data or edit data that has already been added.\par
\pard\tx720\par
\b Steps to Manually Add/Edit Data:\par
\pard{\pntext\f0 1.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent0\pnstart1\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li360\b0 Click in the box where you would like to enter data and begin typing.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Use the Tab key on your keyboard or the left and right arrows to move from side to side within a record.\par
{\pntext\f0 3.\tab}Use the up and down arrows on the keyboard to move from top to bottom between records.\par
{\pntext\f0 4.\tab}For boxes that contain drop-down lists, you can choose your data from the list or begin typing and the matching label will be automatically filled in.\par
{\pntext\f0 5.\tab}For boxes where dates are entered, a calendar pop-up will appear if you click on the calendar icon in the right-hand side of the cell. Select the date from the calendar. Click the header at the top of the pop-up to see other available months. Click the header again to see additional available years. \par
\pard\li360\tx360\tx720\par
\pard\tx720\b Steps for Using Actions Tools:\par
\pard{\pntext\f0 1.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent0\pnstart1\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li360\b0 When you click on the \b Trees\b0  function, the \b Actions\b0  group will become available in the ribbon.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Use the \b New \b0 tool to create a new record in the tree table.\par
{\pntext\f0 3.\tab}Use the \b Delete\b0  tool to remove the selected record(s) from the table.\par
\pard\tx720\par
\pard\b Notes:\par
\pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li360\b0 Taxonomic classes (i.e., Magnoliopsida, Pinopsida, Ginkgoopsida, Liliopsida, Filicopsida, Cycadopsida) should be used sparingly when identifying the species of live trees. These classes can be used to represent the more generic classifications. However, species data is important to the calculation of ecosystem services \endash  more specific species identification provides better model estimates.\par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}If you have imported your data from the mobile data collector using the \b Retrieve from Mobile\b0  function of the \b Data\b0  tab, you will see all of the imported field data for your project here. \par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}If you opened a project or are working with data that was previously entered, you will see all of the field data for your project here.\par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Some data fields are defined on the \b Project Configuration\b0  tab. If you do not see the options you want from the drop-down list for a certain data field, you will need to go back to the \b Project Configuration\b0  tab to edit the list of options for that data field.\par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Use the \b CSV\b0  function in the ribbon to export the tree data here to a \ldblquote comma separated values\rdblquote  (csv) file. Data exported as a csv file are compatible with Microsoft Excel and text editors such as WordPad and Notepad.\par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}If you recorded the GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) of each tree during field data collection, you will be able to make use of Eco's \b KML\b0  function. Use the \b KML\b0  function in the ribbon to export the tree data here to a "keyhole markup language" (kml) file. Data exported as a kml file are compatible with software programs that include Google Earth and ArcGIS and allow you to view tree locations spatially.\par

A complete inventory project is one in which you collect data for all of the trees you are interested in. Examples of complete inventory projects may include a street tree inventory, the assessment of all or selected trees in an individual park or campus, or even an assessment of a selection of heritage or memorial trees in your town. Complete inventories can also be used to project the benefits of a planting project using the Forecast module. Complete inventory projects are most useful when detailed information is needed on each individual tree or the number of trees of interest can be assessed with a reasonable amount of effort.\par

\fi-360\li360\sa200\b0 Select the location where the majority of your study area is located using the drop-down lists. Location is an important project setting because it is used to provide localized benefit estimates. That is, many of the ecosystem service analyses rely on national or finer scale location data. Identify your location as precisely as possible.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Specify whether your study area is urban by checking the appropriate box. If your study area is a mix of urban and rural lands, we recommend that you answer this question based on the more dominant of the two land types. See Notes below.\par
{\pntext\f0 3.\tab}Enter your population values. For all locations the "Population" entered will be used in reports that include "per capita" summaries. For locations in the continental US, the "Population" entered will also be used to scale BenMAP generated health incidences and values as described in the "Pollution Removal" section of Understanding i-Tree\cf1\sub\fs22 1\cf0\nosupersub\fs20 . In select locations, also enter your "Population Density" if prompted and it will be used in the regression equations described by Nowak et al.\cf1\sub 2\cf0\nosupersub  In some instances (e.g. a park or street tree survey) it may be appropriate to use population and/or population density values that reflect your best guess at human population receiving tree related benefits rather than the population within your project boundary.\par
{\pntext\f0 4.\tab}Select the weather and pollution year that you would like to use for your analysis by choosing from the drop-down list. In some cases only a weather year is available. If that choice is made, then the reports that rely on pollution data will not available.\par
{\pntext\f0 5.\tab}The 'Show Pollution Stations' button will display a map of pollutant data for the selected year to be used in processing. Pollutant data are pre-selected based on location and availability.\par
{\pntext\f0 6.\tab}If your project location is in a Tropical Region and you want to use the tropical carbon equations, check the applicable box. For additional information about this option, please see the i-Tree Eco Tropical Carbon Equations\cf1\sub 3\cf0\nosupersub .\par
\pard{\pntext\f0 7.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent0\pnstart1\pndec{\pntxta.}}

The weather data collected at this station is used to help estimate ecosystem services, such as pollution removal. See Notes below.\par
\pard\par
Go through the other tabs, \b Project Settings \b0 and \b Data Collection Options\b0 , which are available in the \b Project Definition\b0  function. When you are satisfied with the project settings that you have entered, click \b OK\b0  in the top right-hand corner of the action panel.\par

\pard{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf3\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li360\b0 For help classifying your study area as urban or rural, urban areas are typically defined as areas of high population density, at least 500 people per square mile (193 people per square kilometer). For additional urban land definitions, see the U.S. Census Bureau\cf1\sub 4\cf0\nosupersub .\par
{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Depending on data availability in the weather year you choose, certain weather stations may not be shown on the map. If there is a weather station that you know you would like to use and it does not appear on the map, you may need to change the weather year that you have selected. Otherwise, the station may not be available because it does not collect the data necessary to run the i-Tree Eco model.\par
\f1{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}Weather data quality is categorized as either Good, Fair, or Poor based on the number of missing hourly weather data. All required weather variables, excluding precipitation, need to meet the following conditions to be classified as: Good = &lt; 720 (8.2%) hours of missing data; Fair = &lt;4,380 (50%) hours missing; Poor = &lt; 8,760 (100%) hours missing. Weather stations that are completely missing data for any required variable are excluded from the weather monitor database.

\pard\b0\par
The table seen in the action panel to the right provides estimates of avian habitat suitability for each plot in your study area. The suitability index reported here is a unitless value meant to capture the ability of an area to sustain a population based on the habitat features that relate to and influence the patterns of abundance of each species. Two suitability index values are given for each plot. One value is based on the trees that were sampled on the plot and the other value assumes an absence of trees on the plot.\par
\par
The index change due to trees is estimated as the following:\par
\par
\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720 A relative change calculated as the absolute change (see below) divided by the suitability index with trees.\par
{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}An absolute change calculated as the suitability index with trees minus the suitability index without trees.\par
\pard\par
The avian species reported here are based on their ranges so only those species present in the study area will be included in the report. Data is available for up to nine bird species, including American robin, Baltimore oriole, black-capped chickadee, Carolina chickadee, European starling, northern cardinal, red-bellied woodpecker, scarlet tanager, and wood thrush.\par

\b0 The planting site type field seen in the action panel on the right is a category that identifies the kind of planting site (e.g., planting strip, cutout) of each tree sampled in your study area. During data collection, you can record the planting site type of each tree that you collect data for. Determining the site type is useful for comparisons with tree conflicts and maintenance recommendations and tasks for understanding problem planting sites for specific species. \par
\par
The list displayed here is used for the planting site type options to choose from in the webform if you collect your field data using a mobile device, as well as in the \b Data\b0  tab of the ribbon. The final list of site types should include all of the classes that exist in your study area (see Notes below). i-Tree Eco includes 7 default planting site types to choose from (see Descriptions below), but you may add or edit site types to customize your project.\par
\par
\b Steps:\par
\b0 1.  When you click on the \b Planting Site Type\b0  function, the \b Actions\b0  group will become available on the ribbon.\par
2.  Use the tools in the \b Actions\b0  group to customize the table of planting site types.\par
3.  The \b Actions\b0  tools allow you to create new classes, delete classes, undo or redo your most recent actions, and restore defaults.\par
4.  Manually enter or edit planting site types by entering a brief description in the description column of the table.\par
5.  Enter the size associate with each planting site type in the size column.\par

The list displayed here is used for the maintenance options to choose from in the webform if you collect your field data using a mobile device, as well as in the Data tab of the ribbon. The final list of maintenance options should include all of the classes that exist in your study area (see Notes below). i-Tree Eco includes 6 default recommended maintenance types to choose from, but you may add up to 4 additional maintenance types to customize your project. i-Tree Eco includes 7 default priority task types to choose from, but you may add up to 3 additional mainetance types to customize your project.\par
\par
The maintenance field seen in the action panel on the right includes two categories: recommended maintenance (e.g., routine maintenance for small tree, immediate maintenance for large tree) and priority task (e.g., clean crown, treat pests). During data collection, you would record the recommended maintenance and priority task of each tree that you collect data for. Determining the maintenance needs of the trees will help with prioritizing, planning and budgeting for future tree care activities. \par

\pard\par
\b0 The report seen in the action panel to the right displays the daily reduction in UV index by trees in your study area. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is emitted by the sun and while beneficial to humans in small doses, can have negative health effects when people are overexposed. The UV index scale was developed by the World Health Organization to more easily communicate daily levels of UV radiation and alert people to when protection from overexposure is needed most. UV index values are estimated from UV radiation and adjusted based on local elevation and cloud cover. Tree canopies help to reduce the amount of UV radiation that reaches the ground thus providing people with additional protection from the sun\rquote s harmful rays. \par
\par
Effects in tree shade are changes in UV for a person who is always shaded by tree canopy. For example, someone who is sitting under a tree. Reduction in UV Index in tree shade is calculated as unshaded UV index minus shaded UV index. This report displays results in line chart and table formats. UV data is from the same year as the user-designated weather and pollution year. It is presented as a daily reduction at solar noon when the sun is highest in the sky.\par

\pard\b0\par
The \b Annual Mortality Rates\b0  function seen in the action panel to the right can be used to customize your Forecast results at a more advanced level. \par
\par
Please note that making changes here is \ul optional\ulnone . If you would like to use the i-Tree Eco defaults, do not make changes in this action panel. If you have already supplied all of the mortality information that you would like to use in the \b Basic Options\b0  function, then do not make further changes in this action panel (see Notes below).\par
\par
If you decide you would like to pursue the advanced mortality options, you must define all of the following variables:\par
\par
\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\sa200\b Mortality type \b0\endash  i-Tree Eco base mortality rates are based on the following classes: healthy trees with 0-49% dieback, sick trees with 50-74% dieback, and dying trees with 75-99% dieback. This variable allows you to define mortality rates for a specific class such as a genus of tree, condition of tree, or specific stratum of the study area.\par
\b{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}Annual mortality rate (%) \b0\endash  i-Tree Eco default base mortality rates are 3.0% for trees with 0-49% dieback, 13.08% for sick trees with 50-74% dieback, and 50% for dying trees with 75-99% dieback. The rate that you provide indicates the percent of trees that will die each year in the class chosen for mortality type. For example, you can choose to model a scenario where all trees identified in the genus Acer have a mortality rate of 1%. In this case, projections for all other trees would use the default base mortality rates or base mortality rates defined by you in the \b Basic Options\b0  function.\par
\b{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}Percent of Starting Population? \b0\endash  i-Tree Eco default assumption is that mortality is calculated on an annual basis. Alternatively, you may choose to calculate mortality based on the starting population. Use these examples to help you decide:\par
\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li1080\sa200\b Annual basis \b0\endash  Let\rquote s say that from our i-Tree Eco results we have 100 healthy trees. If we apply the default 3.0% mortality rate for healthy trees, 3 of those 100 healthy trees will die in the first year. In the second year, the tree mortality would be 3.0% of the remaining 97 healthy trees, which is another 2.91 trees. In the third year, the tree mortality would be 3.0% of 94.09 trees, or 2.8227 trees, and so on.\par
\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li1080\b Percent of starting population \b0\endash  Let\rquote s say that from our i-Tree Eco results we have a starting population of 100 healthy trees. If we apply the default 3.0% mortality rate for healthy trees, then 3 of those trees will die each year. One scenario where this option would be most useful is if you are planning tree removal at a constant rate. For example, emerald ash borer is a pest that can have a devastating impact on ash tree populations. As part of your study area\rquote s management plan, you may choose to remove a certain number of ash trees each year. \par
\pard\par
\b Steps:\par
\pard{\pntext\f0 1.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent0\pnstart1\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li360\b0 Choose your mortality type from the drop-down list. After you select your mortality type, a second drop-down list to the right will be populated with additional options.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}From that second drop-down list, choose the class that you will be defining your mortality rate for. For example, if you choose genus as your mortality type, then you can choose a genus class (e.g., Acer) from the second drop-down list.\par
{\pntext\f0 3.\tab}Define the annual mortality rate for the mortality type and class specified by either typing the rate directly in the box provided or using the up and down arrows on your keyboard to increase or decrease the number.\par
{\pntext\f0 4.\tab}Specify if you would like to calculate tree mortality as a percent of the starting population (see examples above) by checking the box next to the label \b Percent of Starting Population\b0 .\par
{\pntext\f0 5.\tab}To delete the advanced mortality options that you defined, click on the \b Clear \b0 button.\par
{\pntext\f0 6.\tab}Once you have defined a mortality type and class and mortality rate that you are satisfied with, click the \b Add\b0  button.\par
{\pntext\f0 7.\tab}Your advanced mortality options will appear in the table at the bottom of the action panel.\par
{\pntext\f0 8.\tab}You may choose to include multiple advanced mortality options.\par

\pard\brdrb\brdrs\brdrw10\brsp20 Project Configuration &gt; Define Plots &gt; via Google Maps\par
\pard\par
\b0 If you are conducting a plot-based sample, you need to define the plots where you will be collecting your data. The \b via\b0  \b Google\b0  \b Maps\b0  function seen in the action panel to the right is one of the methods for defining your plots. This option allows you to create a sample of plots using Google Maps directly in i-Tree Eco.\par
\par
The random plot generator tool requires you to define the boundary of your study area by providing a GIS shapefile or drawing the boundary yourself. Your sample of plots is then created by randomly distributing plot points throughout your study area. Because these plots are randomly placed, they may fall on rooftops, in water bodies, and in other areas that may seem undesirable. This is the nature of random sampling. However, we recommend that you generate a few extra plots in case some are inaccessible.\par
\par
There are three different options for generating your plots through Google Maps (see Descriptions below).\par
\par
\b Steps for Option 1 \endash  Simple Random (shapefile boundary):\par
\pard{\pntext\f0 1.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent0\pnstart1\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li360\b0 Have an ESRI ArcGIS shapefile of the boundary of your project area ready. You must have the shp, dbf, and shx files associated with this boundary and the shapefile must be in geographic projection (latitude/longitude).\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Select \b Simple random (shapefile boundary)\b0  next to \b Options\b0 .\par
{\pntext\f0 3.\tab}Click on the \b Browse\b0  buttons next to each of the shapefile boxes in turn.\par
{\pntext\f0 4.\tab}For each shapefile box, navigate to the GIS shapefile that you have ready and click \b Open\b0 . (Note: The shapefiles that you enter must be in shp, dbf, and shx formats.) Be sure to select the appropriate format for each entry.\par
{\pntext\f0 5.\tab}Click on the \b Proceed to random plot generation\b0  button.\par
{\pntext\f0 6.\tab}Click \b OK\b0  to proceed.\par
{\pntext\f0 7.\tab}Indicate how large your sample plots should be by either leaving \ldblquote 0.1 Acres is the standard plot size\rdblquote  selected or entering a custom plot size or radius in the box provided.\par
{\pntext\f0 8.\tab}Indicate how many sample plots you would like by entering the number of plots or percent of the project area that you would like to sample in the boxes provided. (Note: The project area based on your study area boundary is shown below the Google Map display.)\par
{\pntext\f0 9.\tab}Click on the \b Generate random sample plots\b0  button.\par

{\pntext\f0 4.\tab}Use the navigation and zoom tools on the right-hand side of the map display to adjust the view of your study area.\par
{\pntext\f0 5.\tab}Use the \b Map\b0  and \b Satellite\b0  buttons at the top of the map display to toggle those displays on and off.\par
{\pntext\f0 6.\tab}To draw your boundary, click on the \b Draw a polygon\b0  tool located above the upper left-hand corner of the map display. While this tool is active, click on the map to start drawing your boundary. Click at each spot where you would like to add a point to your boundary. Double-click to finish the drawing.\par
{\pntext\f0 7.\tab}To delete a boundary that you have drawn, first click on the polygon to select it and then right-click on the polygon. Click on the \b X\b0  button that appears.\par
{\pntext\f0 8.\tab}When you have a boundary that you are satisfied with, click on the \b Done and Continue\b0  button.\par
{\pntext\f0 9.\tab}Indicate how large your sample plots should be by either leaving \ldblquote 0.1 Acres is the standard plot size\rdblquote  selected or entering a custom plot size or radius in the box provided.\par

Your shapefile must have a field in the attribute table indicating the categories you want to stratify by. Stratified random sampling is a more advanced type of sampling than simple random sampling. It allows you to define naturally occurring categories or strata within your area of interest. Strata can be based on any categories you choose. Common examples include land use categories, ownership categories, or neighborhoods. The advantages of stratified random sampling are that you can summarize results by your categories and concentrate sampling in the strata you are most interested in. You can also increase the precision of your population estimates (i.e., decrease standard error) by defining strata so that you would expect plots within a stratum to be relatively similar while you would expect plots from different strata to be relatively dissimilar.\par

Report &gt; Charts &gt; Pollution and Weather &gt; UV Index Reduction by Trees &gt; Effects Overall\par
\pard\par
\b0 The report seen in the action panel to the right displays the daily reduction in UV index by trees in your study area. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is emitted by the sun and while beneficial to humans in small doses, can have negative health effects when people are overexposed. The UV index scale was developed by the World Health Organization to more easily communicate daily levels of UV radiation and alert people to when protection from overexposure is needed most. UV index values are estimated from UV radiation and adjusted based on local elevation and cloud cover. Tree canopies help to reduce the amount of UV radiation that reaches the ground thus providing people with additional protection from the sun\rquote s harmful rays. \par
\par
Overall effects are changes in UV for a person who is in both areas that are shaded by tree canopy and areas that are not. For example, someone who is walking down a street may find themselves under tree canopy at some times and exposed to full UV radiation at others. Reduction in UV Index overall is calculated as unshaded UV index minus overall UV index. This report displays results in line chart and table formats. UV data is from the same year as the user-designated weather and pollution year. It is presented as a daily reduction at solar noon when the sun is highest in the sky.\par

\par
A re-inventory project is one in which you plan to remeasure trees that you previously collected data for. For example, you may have collected data for all of the trees within a park in 2004. In 2014, you decided that you would like to go back to the same park and collect data for the trees again. One of the reasons why you might want to complete a re-inventory project would be to analyze how the urban forest in your study area is changing over time.\par
\par
If you are planning to do a re-inventory project, be sure that it is selected in the drop-down list above, and then click \b OK\b0 .\par
\par
If you are not sure that this project type is the right choice for you, select one of the other project types from the drop-down list to see a description of the other options.\fs22\lang9\par

The report seen in the action panel to the right provides per area (density) estimates of net carbon sequestration of trees by strata in your study area. Net sequestration is a measure of the carbon sequestered by trees calculated as the gross carbon sequestered minus the carbon emissions due to decomposition after tree death. Per area estimates are calculated by dividing the total net carbon sequestration in each stratum by the area of the stratum. Per area estimates are also reported for the carbon dioxide equivalent. This report displays results in bar chart and table formats.\par

\pard\qj\par
\b0 The planting site type field seen in the action panel on the right is a category that identifies the kind of planting site (e.g., planting strip, cutout) of each tree sampled in your study area. During data collection, you can record the planting site type of each tree that you collect data for. Determining the site type is useful for comparisons with tree conflicts and maintenance recommendations and tasks for understanding problem planting sites for specific species. \par
\par
The list displayed here is used for the planting site type options to choose from in the webform if you collect your field data using a mobile device, as well as in the \b Data\b0  tab of the ribbon. The final list of site types should include all of the classes that exist in your study area (see Notes below). i-Tree Eco includes 7 default planting site types to choose from (see Descriptions below), but you may add or edit site types to customize your project.\par
\par
\b Steps:\par
\b0 1.  When you click on the \b Planting Site Type\b0  function, the \b Actions\b0  group will become available on the ribbon.\par
2.  Use the tools in the \b Actions\b0  group to customize the table of planting site types.\par
3.  The \b Actions\b0  tools allow you to create new classes, delete classes, and undo or redo your most recent actions.\par
4.  Manually enter or edit planting site types by entering a brief description in the description column of the table.\par
5.  Enter the size associate with each planting site type in the size column.\par

The suitability index reported here is a unitless value meant to capture the ability of an area to sustain a population based on the habitat features that relate to and influence the patterns of abundance of each species. Two suitability index values are given for each stratum. One value is based on the trees in that stratum and the other value assumes an absence of trees in the stratum.\par

\b0 i-Tree Eco requires users to collect two plot measurements and two tree measurements. While this approach allows users with limited, existing inventories to run the model, it also has substantial limitations. The accuracy of ecosystem service estimates can be improved significantly by providing more optional tree measurements. The information below describes minimum and highly recommended fields available for i-Tree Eco data collection.\par
\par
\b Data &amp; Ecosystem Service Relationships\b0   \par
The letters in parentheses after each description below indicate the ecosystem service or model function affected by the data. Each of these components, excluding energy effect and avian habitat suitability, will be calculated using estimated or default data variables if the highly recommended fields are not collected. Energy effect (E) and avian habitat suitability (H) are optional model components that require additional data and are described in more detail below.\par
 \par
A = air pollution removal; C.Stor = carbon storage; C.Seq. = carbon sequestration; E = energy effect; F = Forecast, R = avoided runoff; S = structural or compensatory value; V = volatile organic compound emissions; U = ultraviolet index effect; H = avian habitat suitability\par

This allows for data collection for a partial plot. For example, if 10% of the plot is obscured from view behind a building or a tall stockade fence on land that you could not get permission to access, you would record 90%. Safety concerns may also be a factor in accessing portions of the plot.\par

\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\b Percent tree cover\b0  \endash  amount of the plot covered by tree canopy. This data is also reported for the entire study area. (A, E, R, U, H)\par

\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\b DBH \b0\endash\b  \b0 diameter at breast height (in/cm) available for up to six stems. The height of the DBH measurement, typically 4.5 feet or 1.37 meters above the ground, is required and used for quality assurance checks or for re-measuring trees in future assessments. Users can choose to input DBH as either measured (discrete values) or categorized. If measured is chosen, no further action is required. If categorized is chosen, users can then choose to customize DBH categories after clicking OK in the top right of this window by navigating to Define Data Fields, DBH in the Project Configuration tab. Once OK is clicked, this option cannot be changed. (C.Stor., C.Seq., F, S, H)\par

The entry adjusts model biomass and decomposition rates and affects compensatory value estimates. The 13 default land use categories are customizable. These land use classes are not used to stratify project results. (C.Seq., S, H)\par
{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}\b Total tree height \b0\endash  a single data entry describing the total tree height from the ground to the top (alive or dead) of the tree. (A, C.Stor., C.Seq., E, F, R, V, H)\par
{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}\b Crown size \b0\endash\b  \b0 requires five data entries, including two measurements of crown width (north to south and east to west), two measurements of crown height (height to live top and height to crown base), and an estimated percent of crown missing volume adjustment, which accounts for areas void of leaves and branches. (A, E, R, V)\par
{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}\b Crown health \b0\endash  a single data entry that users can choose to record as \b Dieback\b0  or \b Condition\b0 . Crown health is based on a visual assessment of the amount of dead branches in the crown. If recording \b Dieback\b0 , users will collect the percent of the crown that is composed of dead branches. If recording \b Condition\b0 , users will enter the inverse of percent dieback (i.e., 100 \endash  percent dieback).  (C.Seq., E, F, S, H)\par

\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\b Crown light exposure \b0\endash  a single data entry indicating the number of sides of tree canopy that receive direct sunlight. This measurement accounts for crown competition and adjusts growth rates. (CStor., C.Seq., F)\par

\pard\par
\b Optional Model Components\par

\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720 Energy\b0  estimates are available for sample and inventory projects in the U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K., and select countries in Europe.  As seen in the descriptions above, energy effect estimates use species and total tree height measurements. We strongly recommend collecting the height variable to improve the quality of your energy effect estimates. In addition, the energy option requires two data entries which the model uses to orient a tree in relationship to an acceptable building.\par

\pard\li720\b\par

\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li1080 Distance to building \b0\endash  the distance from a tree to the closest point of a space-conditioned dwelling. (E)\par

\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li1080\b Direction to building \b0\endash  a compass measurement from the tree to the nearest point of the building. This directional variable orients the tree\rquote s relationship to a structure for energy modeling. (E)\par

\pard\par

\pard\li720 Up to four buildings can be designated to have energy effect relationships with a single tree. Refer to the Eco Field Guide for further discussion on acceptable building types and tree parameters for energy effect modeling.  \par

\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\b Avian Habitat Suitability\b0  estimates are only available for sample projects in the U.S. As seen in the descriptions above, avian habitat suitability is estimated based on percent tree cover, tree diameter (DBH), land use, total tree height, and crown health. Though land use, total tree height, and crown health are not required variables, collecting these data will greatly improve avian habitat suitability estimates. Two additional variables, \b percent shrub cover\b0  and \b ground cover\b0 , are also used in the avian habitat suitability model component. Without collecting these data, wildlife estimates cannot be provided.\par

\pard\par

\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\b User Tree ID \b0 data field allows users to input a unique identifier for individual trees. Eco automatically assigns an ID number for each tree in a project as ordered integers. Although these identification numbers can be changed manually, they cannot be changed during the inventory data import process. Therefore, the User ID field can be used to incorporate tree identifiers applicable to specific inventories.\par

\pard\par
\b Notes:\par

\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\b0 Some data variables include drop-down menus to further define how you will collect your data. If you are collecting \b Street tree/non-street tree\b0  or \b Public/private\b0  tree details, you can choose a default for all trees from the drop-down menu.\par

\pard\li360\par

\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720 Some data variables require you to collect additional variables. By checking the box for one variable, the box for the additional variable will automatically be checked. These variables are defined by a note in parentheses below the variable. If you choose to collect either plot \b Land use \b0 or tree \b Land use\b0 , you will be required to collect the other. If you choose to collect \b Shrub details\b0 , you will be required to collect \b Percent shrub cover\b0 .

\pard\b0\par
The \b Pest Outbreaks \b0 function seen in the action panel to the right can be used to customize your Forecast results at a more advanced level. One of the advantages of defining one or more extreme events, such as a pest outbreak, is that you can model what your urban forest will look like in the future as a result of the loss of trees. You can choose to include a single pest outbreak or multiple ones. \par
\par
Please note that making changes here is optional. If you do not want to include pest outbreak scenarios in your projected results, do not make changes in this action panel (see Notes below). There are no pest outbreak scenarios included by default.\par
\par
If you decide you would like to pursue the pest outbreaks option, you must define all of the following variables:\par
\par
\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\sa200\b Pest species \b0\endash  the pest or disease that causes the outbreak.\par
\b{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}Outbreak occurs in year \b0\endash  the year in which the pest outbreak occurs.\par
\b{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}Lasts how many years \b0\endash  the duration of the pest outbreak. For example, if you set the pest outbreak to begin in Year 5 and last a duration of two years, then your extreme event will end in Year 7.\par
\b{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}Resulting annual mortality (%) \b0\endash  the annual mortality rate that will occur as a result of the pest outbreak scenario. The rate that you provide indicates the percent of trees that will die as a result of the event. Default mortality rates for each pest were derived from the National Insect and Disease Forest Risk Assessment report (2012).\par
\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720\b Plant host trees during event? \b0\endash  determines what types of species will be included in a tree planting scenario. This option is relevant to you if you have defined a pest event \ul and\ulnone  have included tree planting scenarios in the \b Trees to Plant \b0 function. Certain tree species are known to be hosts to harmful pests and diseases. If you select this option, known host trees will be included in the species composition of trees planted.\par
\pard\par
\b Steps:\par
\pard{\pntext\f0 1.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent0\pnstart1\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li360\b0 Choose the pest species from the drop-down list (see Notes below).\par

{\pntext\f0 4.\tab}Set the annual mortality rate that occurs as a result of your pest outbreak by either typing the year directly in the box provided or using the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the number.\par
{\pntext\f0 5.\tab}Indicate whether or not you will be planting host trees during the event.\par
{\pntext\f0 6.\tab}To delete the pest outbreak scenario that you defined, click on the \b Clear\b0  button.\par
{\pntext\f0 7.\tab}Once you have defined a pest outbreak scenario that you are satisfied with, click the \b Add\b0  button.\par
{\pntext\f0 8.\tab}Your pest outbreak scenario will appear in the table at the bottom of the action panel.\par
{\pntext\f0 9.\tab}You may choose to include multiple pest outbreak scenarios.\par
{\pntext\f0 10.\tab}Use the toolbar located above the upper left-hand corner of the table to undo, redo, or delete a pest outbreak scenario in the table.\par

\b Notes:\par
\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li360\b0 Pest outbreak scenarios added here assume that the species composition of lost trees as a result of the event will be even across all known host species.\par

{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}The Forecast component of i-Tree Eco estimates the future structure and function of your urban forest by incorporating anticipated growth and mortality rates.

\pard After you send data and retrieve results on the \b Reports\b0  tab, the \b Editing Mode \b0 function will become available on the \b Data\b0  tab (i.e., it will no longer be greyed out and the function will read \ldblquote Editing Mode: Off\rdblquote ). This indicates that the tab is in View-only mode so each function may be viewed, but not edited.\par
\par
However, the data that you enter in this tab may be edited with caution. In order to do this, you will need to switch to Editing mode by clicking on the \b Editing Mode \b0 function once it has become available. After clicking on it, the function will be greyed out and read \ldblquote Editing Mode: On.\rdblquote  Edits may be made at that time. Please note that if you edit your data, the results in the \b Reports\b0  tab may not reflect the changes that you made.

\pard\par
\b0 The \b Annual Costs\b0  field seen in the action panel to the right identifies the costs associated with your project. The costs entered here and the urban forest benefits estimated by Eco are used to calculate the benefit-cost ratio of those benefits, which can be a valuable public-policy tool. If you are interested in comparing the benefits and costs of your urban forest, you will need to gather annual cost data for your study area (see Notes below).\par
\par
There are no default costs for this field because they can vary significantly from place to place. The values that you provide here are primarily the annual costs associated with the management of your urban forest, such as tree planting or removal. However, there may be less obvious tree-related costs to consider, such as sidewalk repair costs or litigation fees.\par
\par
Already submitted your project to the Eco server and retrieved your results? No problem \endash  this form can be edited at any time and you will not be required to submit your project again. Results on the \b Reports\b0  tab will reflect the change in annual costs immediately.\par

\b Steps:\b0\par
\pard{\pntext\f0 1.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent0\pnstart1\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li360 For previously entered annual costs, use the save function to keep a record of those values. This record is useful in the event that you want to use those annual costs again in the future.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Manually enter the annual costs that you would like the model to use in the boxes (see Notes below).\par
{\pntext\f0 3.\tab}When you are satisfied with the annual costs you have set, click \b OK\b0  in the top right-hand corner of the action panel. This will save the edits that you have made to the costs.\par

Notes:\par
\pard{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf1\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li360\b0 Because benefits are reported as annual sums, citywide costs associated with tree management should also be annual values.\par

This allows the benefit-cost ratio to be calculated separately \endash  for instance, for trees in the right-of-way whose maintenance is paid for by the adjacent property owner versus trees in the right-of-way that are maintained using public funds. If you will distinguish between public and private trees in your inventory, complete the column for private costs to estimate costs associated with private trees.\par

\pard\b0\par
The \b Trees to Plant\b0  function seen in the action panel to the right can be used to customize your Forecast results at a more advanced level. One of the advantages of defining tree planting scenarios is that you can model what your urban forest will look like in the future as a result of one or more tree planting events. You can choose to include a single tree planting event or include multiple plantings to simulate an annual tree planting program. \par
\par
Please note that making changes here is \ul optional\ulnone . If you do not want to include tree planting scenarios in your projected results, do not make changes in this action panel (see Notes below). There are no tree planting scenarios included by default.\par
\par
If you decide you would like to pursue the tree planting option, you must define all of the following variables:\par

{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}Natural ingrowth or regeneration of the urban forest is not accounted for in Forecast modeling.

\b0 The report seen in the action panel to the right displays the daily ultraviolet (UV) index in your study area. UV radiation is emitted by the sun and while beneficial to humans in small doses, can have negative health effects when people are overexposed. The UV index scale was developed by the World Health Organization to more easily communicate daily levels of UV radiation and alert people to when protection from overexposure is needed most. UV index values are estimated from UV radiation and adjusted based on local elevation and cloud cover.\par
\par
This report displays results in line chart and table formats. UV data is from the same year as the user-designated weather and pollution year. It is presented as a daily value at solar noon when the sun is highest in the sky.\par

Data &gt; Data Collection &gt; Submit to Mobile\par
\pard\par
\b0 i-Tree Eco offers multiple methods for recording the data that you collect in the field. One of these methods is to record your data using the mobile data collector. You can access the mobile data collector from any web-enabled mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet, and import your collected data into i-Tree Eco from the web (also available on \b Data\b0  tab of ribbon). The Eco mobile device functionality is not an app that you have to download from a store; it is a web-based inventory data collection form. \par
\par
The purpose of the \b Submit to Mobile\b0  function seen in the action panel to the right is to send your project configuration to the server where you will be able to access it using a mobile device and the i-Tree Eco mobile data collector (see Notes below).\par
\par
\b *IMPORTANT*\par
\b0 Before you can start working with the mobile data collector on your mobile device, you must submit your project configuration here (see Notes below). \i If you do not submit your project configuration, you will not be able to access the mobile data collector from your mobile device.\i0\par
\par
