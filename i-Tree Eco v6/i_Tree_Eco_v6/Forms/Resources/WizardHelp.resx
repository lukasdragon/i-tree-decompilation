    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

Indicate whether or not you will be collecting data for all of the trees in your study area by selecting "Yes" or "No".\par
\b Why It's Important:\par
\b0 There are several different types of inventories that you can do for an i-Tree Eco project.\par
If you plan to collect data for all of the trees in your study area, you will be doing a complete inventory. If this is the case, be sure to select "Yes" here.\par
Another method of data collection is to establish plots within your study area. You would then collect data for all of the trees within your plots. This type of data collection means that you are collecting data for a sample of the trees in your study area and is called a plot-based inventory.\par

\b Why It's Important:\par
\b0 i-Tree Eco gives you the option to collect additional, custom data for your project. This allows you to define additional fields that you are interested in and customize your project further.\par
For example, you may decide that you would like to identify if the trees that you collect data for are invasive species or not. Adding custom data variables would allow you to include this in your analysis.\par

\b Why It's Important:\par
\b0 There are many optional data variables that you can collect that make your i-Tree Eco analysis more robust. Some of the variables are tree specific data, while others relate to the site where you are collecting your data.\par
Some data variables can be estimated by i-Tree Eco, but the more data you collect in the field the better your results will be. Keep in mind that choosing not to collect certain variables, such as IPED, means that some analyses will not be included in your final results. Additionally, some optional variables are more time intensive to collect than others.\par

When you establish plots for your project, you have the option to do a linear sample. A linear sample allows you to collect data along a linear path, such as a street, street segment, or utility right-of-way. For example, you might decide that you want to analyze only the trees that line the streets in your neighborhood. In this case, a linear sample is appropriate.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\b\f0\fs18\lang9 What To Do:\b0\par
Choose the existing database where your project for remeasurement is saved by browsing to the folder where it is saved and selecting it. After selected, the existing database name will appear in the box.\par
\b Why It's Important:\par
\b0 You have decided that you will be completing a reinventory project. This means that you will be remeasuring data that you have collected in the past. For this reason, you must inform i-Tree Eco where your previous project is saved.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f0\fs18\lang9 The New Project Wizard acts as a project setup assistant. You will be asked a series of questions that will make it easier for you to design your new i-Tree Eco project.\par
If you are already familiar with i-Tree Eco and would like to start a new project without using the wizard, please be sure to select "No." Check the box at the bottom of the window and the wizard will not appear in the future.\par
To access the wizard from the i-Tree Eco window go to the New Project Wizard tool located in the Help tab of the ribbon.\par

Enter a series name for your project in the box provided.\par
\b Why It's Important:\par
\b0 The series name is an important setting in i-Tree Eco because it gives your project a unique identity.\par
For the majority of new projects, a new series is created. However, in the future you can choose to add data to an existing series. This type of project is a reinventory and is done only if you plan to remeasure data that you collected previously. In this instance, your series name is used to reference your past data collection and identify where your new data will be added. \par

Select your weather station by clicking on the "Show Map" button. In the window that appears, select the weather station that you would like to use in your analysis.\par
\b Why It's Important:\par
\b0 i-Tree Eco uses weather data to help estimate the ecosystem services, such as pollution removal, provided by the urban forest in your study area.\par
Please note that depending on the weather year you choose, certain weather stations may not be available. If there is a weather station that you know you would like to choose and it does not appear on the map, you may need to change the weather year.\par

Select the location where the majority of your study area is located using the drop-down lists.\par
\b Why It's Important:\par
\b0 Location is an important project setting in i-Tree Eco for many reasons. It is used to provide localized benefit estimates. That is, many of the ecosystem service analyses rely on national, state, or county-level data.\par
Please note that i-Tree Eco allows you to enter a county as your location. You are not required to choose a place. However, if you are doing a project that is not at the county scale, a more refined location may provide better estimates.\par

\b Why It's Important:\b0\par

\pard\lang1033 There are different types of new projects that you can complete in i-Tree Eco, including a reinventory. A reinventory project is a project where you plan to remeasure trees that you previously collected data for.\par
\par
For example, you may have collected data for all of the trees within a park in 2004. In 2014, you decided that you would like to go back to the same park and collect data for the trees again.\par
\par
One of the reasons that you might want to complete a reinventory project would be to analyze how the urban forest in your study area is changing over time.\lang9\par

Enter a series year for your project in the box provided.\par
\b Why It's Important:\par
\b0 A reinventory project means that you are adding data to an existing series by remeasuring data that you collected in the past. One of the ways that you differentiate your new data from the old data in the series is by defining your series year.\par
The series year for your new data must be different from the series year that you used in the past.\par
For example, if you choose to collect data for all of the trees in a park in 2000 then remeasure that park in 2014 these data will be saved within the same series. By giving each set of data a different series year, such as 2000 and 2014, you will be able to look at the datasets separately and compare them to each other.\par
