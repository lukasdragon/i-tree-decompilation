    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

\pard\b0\fs22 On this tab, you can set up your new i-Tree Eco project or make changes to the settings that you provided for an existing project. On the ribbon above, there are five groups of available functions (see Notes below), including:\par
\par
\cf1\b Project Definition \cf0\b0\endash  to define important project settings such as the location of your study area and your data collection variables.\b\par
\par
\cf1 Define Data Fields\b0  \cf0\endash  to view or edit classes for different data fields.\par
\b\par
\cf1 Project &amp; Strata\b0  \b Area\b0  \cf0\endash  to identify the area of your project or strata and define strata or zones by which you are stratifying your project (i.e., subdividing the study area into smaller units such as land use classes).\par

\b0 After you send data and retrieve results on the \b Reports\b0  tab, the \b Editing Mode \b0 function will become unavailable on the \b Project Configuration\b0  tab (i.e., it will no longer be greyed out and the function will read \ldblquote Editing Mode: Off\rdblquote ). This indicates that the tab is in view-only mode so each function may be viewed, but not edited.\par
\par

\pard\widctlpar When a project is in view-only mode, the project settings that you enter in this tab may be edited with caution. In order to do this, you will need to switch to Editing mode by clicking on the \b Editing Mode \b0 function once it has become available. After clicking on it, the function will be greyed out and read \ldblquote Editing Mode: On.\rdblquote  Edits may be made at that time. Please note that if you edit your project configuration, the results in the \b Reports\b0  tab may not reflect the changes that you made. To ensure that they do, send your data to the server and load your results again.\par

\pard\b0\fs22 Forecast is a separate component of i-Tree Eco that is run independently of the model. Utilizing Forecast is entirely optional and will have no impact on your i-Tree Eco results (as seen on the \b Reports\b0  tab).\par
\par
On this tab, you can run the Forecast component at a basic or advanced level. To estimate what your urban forest will look like in the future, Forecast uses the structural estimates (e.g., number of trees, species composition) generated by running the i-Tree Eco model along with anticipated growth and mortality rates. You can even include future tree planting scenarios or possible adverse events, such as a storm or pest infestation, to predict their impact on your urban forest.\par
\par
Forecast is designed to allow you to provide as little or as much information as you would like (see Notes below). At the most basic level, you could run Forecast using all of the defaults provided. To customize your Forecast results, you can change the default \b Basic Options\b0  to estimate your future urban forest based on local variables for the following:\par

\pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720 Number of years to forecast\par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Annual mortality rates\par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Frost-free period (days)\par

\pard\par
For a more advanced Forecast run, you can choose to include the following occurrences in your estimates of the future urban forest:\par

\pard{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf2\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-360\li720 Tree plantings\par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}Storm events\par

*IMPORTANT*\par
\b0 After you run Forecast, the \b Editing Mode \b0 function will become available on the ribbon (i.e., it will no longer be greyed out and the function will read \ldblquote Editing Mode: Off\rdblquote ). This indicates that the \b Forecast\b0  tab is in View-only mode so each function may be viewed, but not edited. Your reports can still be viewed, saved, and printed. \par
\par
However, if you decide that you would like to make changes to your active configuration, you will need to switch to Editing mode by clicking on the \b Editing Mode \b0 function once it has become available. After clicking on it, the function will be greyed out and read \ldblquote Editing Mode: On.\rdblquote  Please note that this will clear all of the reports on the \b Forecast\b0  tab that are associated with this configuration and you will be required to \b Run Forecast \b0 to view those reports again.\par

Simply make sure that \b Default\b0  is chosen in the \b Active Configuration\b0  drop-down list of the \b Configurations \b0 group, and click the \b Run Forecast\b0  button in the ribbon. You will be able to view all of the default parameters used by clicking on the \b Configuration Summary\b0  button.\par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}The \b Forecast\b0  tab is greyed out until after you have submitted your data and loaded your results on the \b Reports\b0  tab. The reason that Forecast is not available at all times is that this component uses the results of the i-Tree Eco model to estimate the structure and function that your urban forest will provide in the future.\par
{\pntext\f2\'B7\tab}The reports are greyed out on the ribbon and cannot be accessed until after you run Forecast. We recommend going through the functions from left to right. Remember: Many of these functions are optional and do not \ul need\ulnone  to be completed.\par

\pard\b0\fs22 On this tab, you can set up your new i-Tree Eco project or make changes to the settings that you provided for an existing project. On the ribbon above, there are six groups of available functions (see Notes below), including:\par
\par
\cf1\b Project Definition\cf0  \b0\endash  to define important project settings such as the location of your study area and your data collection variables.\b\par
\par
\cf1 Define Data Fields\b0  \cf0\endash  to view or edit categories for different data fields.\par
\par
\cf1\b Define Plots\b0  \cf0\endash  to identify the locations of the plots where data will be collected for your plot-based sample.\par
\par
\cf1\b Project &amp; Strata Area\b0  \cf0\endash  to identify the area of your project or strata and define the strata or zones by which you are stratifying your project (i.e., subdividing the study area into smaller units such as land use classes).\par
\b\par
\cf1 Export\cf0  \b0\endash  to export an open data table to a \ldblquote comma separated values\rdblquote  (csv) file.\b\par
 \par
\cf1 Editing Mode\b0  \cf0\endash  to turn Editing mode on.\par
\b\par
*IMPORTANT*\par
\b0 After you send data and retrieve results on the \b Reports\b0  tab, the \b Editing Mode \b0 function will become unavailable on the \b Project Configuration\b0  tab (i.e., it will no longer be greyed out and the function will read \ldblquote Editing Mode: Off\rdblquote ). This indicates that the tab is in view-only mode so each function may be viewed, but not edited.\par
\par

\pard\widctlpar When a project is in view-only mode, the project settings that you enter in this tab may be edited with caution. In order to do this, you will need to switch to Editing mode by clicking on the \b Editing Mode \b0 function once it has become available. After clicking on it, the function will be greyed out and read \ldblquote Editing Mode: On.\rdblquote  Edits may be made at that time. Please note that if you edit your project configuration, the results in the \b Reports\b0  tab may not reflect the changes that you made. To ensure that they do, send your data to the server and load your results again.\par
